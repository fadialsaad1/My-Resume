        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p id="summary">
          I am a Computer Science student who is becoming more and more interested in Data Science and Analytics. Through my studies, I have built a solid background in programming, algorithms,
          and data structures, which has helped me understand how technology works at a deeper level. In addition to my academic work,
          I have also gained practical experience while working at a retail store that uses ECRS POS (point of sale) systems. This job has shown me how businesses rely on technology
          and data to run daily operations, manage sales, and improve customer service.
          Combining my education with this real-world experience has strengthened my interest in using data to solve problems and make smarter decisions.

              I work at a retail store where I manage the POS system powered by ECRS software. My responsibilities
              include tracking inventory, updating prices, importing vendor and supplier files, and generating various
              reports.

            </li>

            <li>
              When I first joined, I started in the grocery department, stocking shelves and learning about the
              products. Because of my computer skills and familiarity with the store’s inventory, I was chosen to
              transition into working with the new ECRS POS system when it was implemented.
